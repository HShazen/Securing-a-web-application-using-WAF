# Securing a web application using WAF
## Introduction:
This humor work was my final project to get my Bachalor's in Computer Science after three years of studying at Univercity of Algers.<br>
WAF in short of Web Application Firewall, this technologie allow you to protect a web application from many layer 7 attacks (application layer of OSI model) such as: SQL Injection, DoS, DDoS, XSS, ...etc.\\
WAF act like a bariare between the web application and the user, filtering HTTP/HTTPS and block mulousuce request follow a list of predefined rules called policies.\\
The most powerful point of WAF is that you are able to deal with a large number of web application at the same time, as we know it is quit impossible to make a perfect application with zero vulnerabilities, because as much you need to secure your application and block attacks, you have to allow legistimate users access it.
